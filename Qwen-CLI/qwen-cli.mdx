# Integrating Kimi K2 with Qwen CLI

The Qwen CLI provides a powerful interface for code-aware conversations and agentic interactions. While designed for Qwen models, it offers excellent compatibility with Kimi K2 through OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## What is Qwen CLI?

Qwen CLI is designed with a focus on:
- **Code-aware conversations** - Understands your codebase context
- **Agentic interactions** - Performs tasks autonomously
- **Multi-provider support** - Works with OpenAI-compatible APIs

This makes it perfect for leveraging Kimi K2's agentic capabilities in your development workflow.

## Installation

Install Qwen CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code
```

<Note>
You don't need to set environment variables beforehand - the CLI will guide you through authentication.
</Note>

## Initial Setup

After installation, run the CLI to start the authentication process:

```bash
qwen
```

You'll be prompted to configure authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="API Key Configuration">
    When prompted, enter your OpenRouter API key:
    ```
    API Keys: sk-or-v1-your-openrouter-key-here
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Base URL Setup">
    Set the OpenRouter base URL:
    ```
    Base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Model Selection">
    Specify the Kimi K2 model:
    ```
    Model: moonshotai/kimi-k2
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

Once configured, verify the integration is working:

```bash
qwen "Hello, can you tell me which model you are?"
```

You should see a response confirming it's using Kimi K2 through the OpenRouter API.

## Key Features with Kimi K2

### Code-Aware Conversations

Qwen CLI automatically understands your project context:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Ask context-aware questions
qwen "What's the main purpose of this codebase?"
qwen "How can I optimize the database queries in this project?"
```

### Agentic Task Execution

Leverage Kimi K2's execution capabilities:

```bash
# Autonomous code generation
qwen "Create a complete REST API for user management with authentication"

# Database optimization
qwen "Analyze and optimize all SQL queries in this project"

# Testing automation
qwen "Write comprehensive tests for the user service module"
```

### Multi-Step Workflows

Kimi K2 excels at complex, multi-step tasks through Qwen CLI:

```bash
qwen "Refactor this codebase to use TypeScript, add proper error handling, and create documentation"
```

## Practical Examples

### Frontend Development

Create a complete Svelte 5 application with Firebase integration:

```bash
qwen "Create a complete todo application using Svelte 5 and Firebase, with custom SVG icons and smooth animations throughout"
```

<Tip>
As shown in our testing, Kimi K2 often accomplishes complex frontend tasks in a single iteration, making it highly cost-effective.
</Tip>

### API Integration

Build API integrations with proper error handling:

```bash
qwen "Create a Node.js service that integrates with the GitHub API, handles rate limiting, and provides caching"
```

### Code Analysis

Analyze existing codebases for improvements:

```bash
qwen "Analyze this codebase for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements"
```

## Cost Tracking

Monitor your usage through OpenRouter's dashboard:

1. Visit your OpenRouter account
2. Check the **Usage** section
3. Track costs per model/request

<Info>
Typical costs for complex tasks range from $0.30-$0.50, making Kimi K2 highly cost-effective for development work.
</Info>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Model Parameters

You can create a configuration file to customize model behavior:

```json
{
  "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2",
  "temperature": 0.1,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "top_p": 0.9
}
```

### Project-Specific Settings

Create a `.qwen` configuration file in your project root:

```json
{
  "context_files": [
    "package.json",
    "README.md",
    "src/**/*.ts"
  ],
  "ignore_patterns": [
    "node_modules/**",
    "dist/**",
    "*.log"
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration

Use Qwen CLI for git-related tasks:

```bash
# Generate commit messages
qwen "Generate a commit message for the current staged changes"

# Code review
qwen "Review the changes in the last commit and suggest improvements"
```

### Documentation Generation

Automatically generate documentation:

```bash
qwen "Generate comprehensive API documentation for this project"
qwen "Create a README.md file that explains the project setup and usage"
```

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Improve code quality:

```bash
qwen "Add unit tests for all utility functions"
qwen "Refactor this code to follow best practices and improve maintainability"
```
