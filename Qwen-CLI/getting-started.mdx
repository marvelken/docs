# Getting Started with Kimi K2 API

This guide walks you through setting up Kimi K2 API access through OpenRouter or direct Moonshot integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js 16+ installed
- An OpenRouter account OR Moonshot account
- Basic familiarity with command-line tools

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

Choose between OpenRouter (recommended for beginners) or direct Moonshot access:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenRouter (Recommended)">
    1. Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
    2. Create a free account
    3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
    4. Generate a new API key (starts with `sk-or-v1-`)
    5. Save this key securely

    <Note>OpenRouter provides unified API access to multiple models and better rate limiting for beginners.</Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Direct Moonshot">
    1. Go to [platform.moonshot.ai](https://platform.moonshot.ai)
    2. Create an account
    3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
    4. Generate a new API key
    5. Save this key securely

    <Warning>Direct Moonshot access may have stricter rate limits and requires more configuration.</Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Install Claude Code Router

The Claude Code Router acts as a local proxy to make Kimi K2 compatible with Claude-based tools:

```bash
# Install globally from npm
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

<Warning>Don't clone from GitHub - the published npm version works better and is more stable.</Warning>

## Step 3: Configure the Router

Start the configuration process:

```bash
ccr start
```

You'll be prompted for configuration. Choose your setup:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenRouter Configuration">
    ```bash
    Provider name: openrouter
    API base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    API key: sk-or-v1-your-actual-key-here
    Model name: moonshotai/kimi-k2
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Moonshot Configuration">
    ```bash
    Provider name: moonshot
    API base URL: https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic
    API key: your-moonshot-api-key
    Model name: kimi-k2
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Verify Setup

After successful configuration, you should see:

```
openrouter provider registered
ðŸš€ LLMs API server listening on http://127.0.0.1:3456
```

Test your setup with a simple command:

```bash
ccr code "Write a Python function to read CSV files"
```

## Step 5: Understanding Rate Limits

### Free Tier Limitations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Concurrency" icon="users">
    **1 request** - Only one simultaneous API request
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tokens Per Minute" icon="clock">
    **64,000 TPM** - Up to 64k tokens processed per minute
  </Card>
  <Card title="Requests Per Minute" icon="gauge">
    **6 RPM** - Only 6 API calls per minute (one every 10 seconds)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tokens Per Day" icon="calendar">
    **3,000,000 TPD** - 3 million tokens maximum per day
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
The 6 RPM limit makes the free tier suitable for testing and small personal projects, but you'll need to upgrade for production use.
</Info>

### Upgrading for Production

For serious development work, consider upgrading:
- As little as **$3** significantly improves rate limits
- Better concurrency and RPM allowances
- More suitable for production workflows

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Providers Setup

Edit `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` to add multiple providers:

```json
{
  "LOG": false,
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
  "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "", 
  "OPENAI_MODEL": "",
  "Providers": [
    {
      "name": "openrouter",
      "api_base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-or-v1-your-key",
      "models": ["moonshotai/kimi-k2"]
    },
    {
      "name": "moonshot", 
      "api_base_url": "https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic",
      "api_key": "your-moonshot-key",
      "models": ["kimi-k2"]
    }
  ],
  "Router": {
    "default": "moonshot,kimi-k2",
    "fallback": "openrouter,moonshotai/kimi-k2"
  }
}
```

### Why This Setup Works

The Claude Code Router architecture:

1. **Local Proxy** - Acts as a bridge between your tools and Kimi K2
2. **Authentication** - Your API key authenticates with the chosen provider
3. **Request Forwarding** - Provider forwards requests to Kimi K2
4. **Billing** - You're billed through your chosen provider
5. **Compatibility** - Any Claude-compatible tool can now use Kimi K2

## Next Steps

Now that you have Kimi K2 configured, you can:

1. **Integrate with Qwen CLI** - Follow our [Qwen CLI Integration](/kimi-k2/qwen-cli) guide
2. **Explore API Examples** - Check out [API Configuration Examples](/kimi-k2/api-examples)
3. **Troubleshoot Issues** - Visit our [Troubleshooting Guide](/kimi-k2/troubleshooting)

<Tip>
Start with small test projects to understand Kimi K2's capabilities before integrating into larger workflows.
