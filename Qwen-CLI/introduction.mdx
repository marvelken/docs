# Kimi K2: Agentic AI for Code Execution

Kimi K2 represents a fundamental shift in how AI models approach tasks. Unlike reasoning models that focus on thinking through problems, Kimi K2 was designed from the ground up to **execute** tasks autonomously.

## What Makes Kimi K2 Different

While most AI models answer questions and offer suggestions through chat interfaces, Kimi K2 doesn't just tell you what to write or how to solve a problemâ€”it writes the code, executes the tasks, and gets things done.

## Access Methods

You can access Kimi K2 through multiple channels:

1. **Web Interface** - Free access at [kimi.com](https://kimi.com)
2. **AI-powered IDEs** - Integration with tools like Windsurf
3. **API Access** - Direct integration via Moonshot or OpenRouter
4. **Self-hosting** - Deploy on your own infrastructure with vLLM, SGLang, KTransformers, or TensorRT-LLM

## Pricing

<Note>
The free tier includes 3M tokens per day but is limited to 6 RPM and 1 concurrent request, making it suitable for testing but not production use.
</Note>

**API Pricing:**
- Input: $0.60 per 1M tokens
- Output: $2.50 per 1M tokens
