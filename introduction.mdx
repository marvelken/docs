Qwen CLI provides comprehensive access to different AI models that understand how developers work and what they need to build exceptional software. 

By combining agentic task execution with multi-model access and enterprise-grade reliability, Qwen CLI offers development capabilities that help you deliver the best code for every project.

## OpenAI Compatibility

Qwen CLI is fully compatible with OpenAI's API structure, making migration seamless:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript OpenAI SDK
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
apiKey: 'your-openrouter-key',
baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1'
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
model: 'qwen/qwen-3-coder',
messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a Python function' }]
});

````

```bash cURL
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Debug this code"}]
  }'
````

```python Python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your-openrouter-key",
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="x-ai/grok-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this system"}]
)
```
