## Integration Patterns

### Sequential Analysis

Use Grok 4 for planning, then other models for implementation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Architecture Planning">
    ```bash
    # Use Grok 4 for high-level design
    qwen --model x-ai/grok-4 \
         "Design complete system architecture" > architecture.md
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implementation Planning">
    ```bash
    # Break down into implementable components
    qwen --model x-ai/grok-4 \
         --context architecture.md \
         "Create detailed implementation plan" > implementation.md
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Code Generation">
    ```bash
    # Use Kimi K2 for autonomous implementation
    qwen --model moonshotai/kimi-k2 \
         --context implementation.md \
         "Implement the user service component"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Effective Prompting">
    **Provide comprehensive context**:
    - Business requirements and constraints
    - Current system limitations
    - Performance and scale requirements
    - Compliance and security needs
    - Budget and timeline constraints
    
    **Example**:
    ```bash
    qwen --model x-ai/grok-4 \
         "Our e-commerce platform currently handles 100K daily orders using a monolithic architecture on AWS. 
         We're experiencing performance issues during peak times and need to scale to 1M daily orders within 12 months.
         
         Constraints:
         - Budget: $50K/month infrastructure
         - Team: 8 developers, 2 DevOps engineers
         - Compliance: PCI DSS required
         - Timeline: 12-month migration window
         
         Design a migration strategy and target architecture."
    ```

## Cost Optimization

<Note>
Grok 4 is the most expensive model but provides exceptional value for complex reasoning tasks that would otherwise require extensive consulting or multiple iterations with other models.
</Note>

**Use Grok 4 efficiently**:
- For high-level architecture and planning
- When deep analysis is needed
- For strategic technical decisions
- To avoid costly architectural mistakes
