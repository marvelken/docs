# Grok-4 Integration

Grok-4 represents the latest advancement in AI reasoning and code generation. This guide covers how to integrate Grok-4 with your development workflow through various APIs and tools.

## Overview

Grok-4 excels at:
- Advanced reasoning and problem-solving
- Complex code generation and optimization
- Multi-step workflow planning
- Technical analysis and debugging
- System architecture design

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Access">
    Access Grok-4 through supported providers:
    - **OpenRouter**: Most convenient for multi-model access
    - **Direct xAI API**: For dedicated Grok access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Qwen CLI">
    ```bash
    qwen config set api_key "your-api-key"
    qwen config set base_url "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    qwen config set model "x-ai/grok-4"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Integration">
    ```bash
    qwen "Explain the architecture of a distributed microservices system"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'HTTP-Referer': 'https://your-domain.com'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'x-ai/grok-4',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user', 
        content: 'Your complex reasoning task here'
      }
    ],
    temperature: 0.1,
    max_tokens: 4096
  })
});
```

### Python Integration

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="your-openrouter-key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="x-ai/grok-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt here"}
    ],
    temperature=0.1
)
```
